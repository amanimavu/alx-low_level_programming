# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

This directory was created to contain task that would help me
understand the concept of hash maps and hash tables.
<br>

The concept of hash tables and hash maps further give me an
insight into how python dictionaries work. However, python
dictionaries don't use the exact implementation as the one
I worked on in this project.
<br>

To get the full implemenattion of python dictionaries. Check the
link: [ how dictionaries are implemented in Python 2.7 ] (http://www.laurentluce.com/posts/python-dictionary-implementation/)
